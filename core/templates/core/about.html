                    With over 50 years of heritage, Inked Clippers has a rich history of serving the community with
                    exceptional barbering, tattooing, and piercing services. Our journey began as "Clippers," a modest
                    barbershop founded by the visionary artist Mike O'Brien in the heart of Ennis. Over the years, we
                    have
                    earned the trust and loyalty of our clients, becoming an integral part of their lives and stories.
                </p>

                <p class="text-center">Today, we proudly carry on this tradition, blending the artistry of
                    our
                    founder with modern techniques and innovations. In 2015, the legacy of Clippers evolved into Inked
                    Clippers when Darren returned from his global tattooing and piercing journey to merge his expertise
                    with
                    the established barbershop. Whether you're a seasoned client or a first-time visitor, our mission
                    remains the same: to provide an unmatched experience that leaves you inspired and transformed.
                    Join us at Inked Clippers, where passion, art, and community converge to
                    redefine self-expression, one masterpiece at a time.</p>

                <p class="text-center">In 1965, the visionary artist Mike O'Brien founded "Clippers," a
                    modest barbershop that quickly gained a reputation for excellence in Ennis. Mike's dedication to his
                    craft and commitment to fostering meaningful connections with clients laid the groundwork for what
                    would become our enduring legacy. As the years passed, the founder's two sons, Robert and Darren,
                    embraced their artistic callings. Robert joined his father in the barbershop, adding his
                    contemporary flair to the age-old craft. Together, they created a welcoming atmosphere that made
                    clients feel like family.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">Meanwhile, Darren pursued his dream of mastering tattoo artistry and
                    piercing, embarking on a global journey to learn from the world's finest artists. His experiences
                    abroad enriched his artistry and brought fresh perspectives to the family business. In the face of
                    adversity and the passing of our beloved founder, Mike
                    O'Brien, after 60 years of service, Robert assumed the reins of Clippers, ensuring the continuation
                    of our cherished legacy. In 2015, Darren returned home, ready to merge his tattooing and piercing
                    expertise with the established barbershop, and thus, Inked Clippers was born.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">Today, our team of barbers, tattoo artists, and piercers works in
                    harmony, transforming every visit into an immersive journey of self-discovery and self-expression.
                    Inked Clippers stands as a testament to the power of art to unite
                    generations and tell stories that span decades. We honor the memory of our father, Mike O'Brien,
                    while embracing the future, welcoming clients from all walks of life into our ever-evolving family
                    in Ennis.
